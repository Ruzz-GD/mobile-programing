Install MariaDB:
Ensure you have MariaDB installed. If you haven't done this yet, run the following command:
-> pkg install mariadb


Create a directory for the MariaDB data. In Termux, run the following command:
-> mkdir -p $HOME/mysql_data


Set up the MariaDB database with your data directory:
-> mariadb-install-db --datadir=$HOME/mysql_data &


Start the MariaDB server in safe mode, bypassing the grant tables:
-> mariadbd-safe --skip-grant-tables --datadir=$HOME/mysql_data &


Access MariaDB:
Open the MariaDB prompt:
-> mariadb


Create a new user. Here, root is the username and 1234 is the password, but you can change them to whatever you want:
-> CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';


Grant the user all privileges on the database. If you are not using the root username, change 'root' to your desired username:
-> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


Apply the changes:
-> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Running MariaDB:
To start the MariaDB server later, use:
-> mariadbd-safe --datadir=$HOME/mysql_data &


Accessing MariaDB:
To access MariaDB with your user, run:
-> mysql -u root -p


All commands are preceded by ->, indicating what needs to be run in the terminal.


Extra:
If you encounter an error during your MariaDB setup, you can reinstall it by following these steps in your Termux home directory:

1. Uninstall MariaDB:
-> pkg uninstall mariadb

2. Remove the MariaDB data and configuration directories:
-> rm -rf $PREFIX/var/lib/mysql
-> rm -rf $PREFIX/etc/mysql

3. Install MariaDB again:
-> pkg install mariadb

Make sure to follow the configuration carefully to avoid any errors.
