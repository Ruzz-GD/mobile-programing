## User Guide for Mobile Htdocs Setup
### This guide will help you set up and run a local web server on your mobile device using Termux. This setup mimics the traditional XAMPP htdocs folder, allowing you to develop websites directly from your phone.

## Clone into Shared Storage:
### First, you need to set up Termux to access your phone's shared storage. This will allow you to manage files both in Termux and from your file manager or other apps.
```
termux-setup-storage
```
### Once you’ve set up access, you can now clone the repository directly into your phone’s shared storage, allowing you to edit files from any file manager or app outside Termux:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ruzz-GD/mobile-htdocs.git ~/storage/shared/mobile-htdocs
```
